Comment: See source files for details.
 The libffi source distribution contains certain code that is not part
 of libffi, and is only used as tooling to assist with the building and
 testing of libffi.  This includes the msvcc.sh script used to wrap the
 Microsoft compiler with GNU compatible command-line options,
 make_sunver.pl, and the libffi test code distributed in the
 testsuite/libffi.bhaible directory.  This code is distributed with
 libffi for the purpose of convenience only, and libffi is in no way
 derived from this code.
