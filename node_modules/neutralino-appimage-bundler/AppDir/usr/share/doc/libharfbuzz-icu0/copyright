 SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE
 .
 Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
 .
 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
 Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
 copyright statement(s).
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 .
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
 or substituting - in part or in whole - any of the components of the
 Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
 new environment.
 .
 "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
 writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
 .
 PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
 a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
 redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
 Software, subject to the following conditions:
 .
 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
 in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
 .
 2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
 contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be

 PREAMBLE
 This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
 bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
 are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
 any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
 licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
 derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
 purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
 the fonts.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
 Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
 as received under this licence.
 .
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
 or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
 Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
 a new environment.
 .
 "Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
 copyright ownership of the Font Software.
 .
 "Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
 identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
 Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.
 .
 To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
 a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
 countries other activities as well.
 .
 PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a

 .
 2) The font name complies with the following:
 (a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
 (b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
 avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
 (c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
 renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
 additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
 Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
 the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
 the new work, appended to that name.
 .
 3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
 Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
