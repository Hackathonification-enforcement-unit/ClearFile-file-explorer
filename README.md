# Gravity File Browser: Because Your Files Were Getting Too Comfortable

===========================================================

**Functional Dysfunctional** was the theme of the Lewis Menelaws's Hackathon, and we took it to heart. Our team of misfits created a file browser that's so bad, it's good. Introducing Gravity File Browser, the app that will make you question your life choices.

## What is this abomination?

---------------------------

Gravity File Browser is a Neutralinojs-based file browser with a unique gravity-inspired interface. Because who needs a normal file browser when you can have one that looks like a hot mess?

## Features

------------

* A gravity-inspired interface that will make you feel like you're floating in a sea of files
* File browsing and management, because you still need to get work done somehow
* Support for directories and files, but don't expect it to work all the time
* File size calculation, because who doesn't love a good game of "guess the file size"?
* Error handling for locked or inaccessible files, which will happen more often than you think

## Credits

--------

We'd like to thank the following people for their contributions to this monstrosity:

* stefdp for their help with the Neutralinojs framework, which we promptly broke
* creeperita104 for their input on the app's design and user experience, which we ignored

## Release

--------

We're happy to announce that Gravity File Browser is now available for public use, and we're not entirely sure why. You can download the latest release from our repository and use it on your own machine, but don't say we didn't warn you.

## Prebuilt Binaries

-------------------

We've also provided prebuilt binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux, because we know you're too lazy to build it yourself. Just download the binary for your platform, extract it, and run the executable. It's that easy!

* Windows: `gravity-file-browser-win.zip`
* macOS: `gravity-file-browser-mac.zip`
* Linux: `gravity-file-browser-linux.zip`

## Requirements

---------------

* Neutralinojs 5.3.0 or later,
* Node.js 14 or later
* Only Linux and Windows versions have been tested.
* Ensure the executable and `resources.neu` are in the same directory.

**Linux Dependencies:**

* `libwebgtk-4.0` is required for the application to start.
* On Ubuntu-based distributions, create symbolic links for the required dependencies:
 	* `sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwebkit2gtk-4.1.so.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwebkit2gtk-4.0.so.37`
 	* `sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1.so.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0.so.18`
 Note: Ubuntu ships a different version of the dependency, requiring these additional steps.

## Installation (if you're feeling adventurous)

------------------------------------------------

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/gravity-file-browser.git`
2. Run: `neu run`

## Usage

-----

1. Launch the app and navigate to a directory using the file browser, if it works
2. Files will fly across the screen, creating a gravity-inspired effect, which will give you a headache
3. Click on a file to view its details, including size and type, if you're lucky
4. Use the navigation bar to switch between directories and go back to previous locations, but don't expect it to work
